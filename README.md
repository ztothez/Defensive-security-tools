# Defensive Security Tools

Small Python utilities focused on basic security analysis and defensive checks.

This repository contains scripts that support early-stage blue-team workflows and security experimentation.

## Included tools
- Simple analysis helpers
- Lightweight security scanning logic
- Scripted checks intended to be extended or integrated elsewhere

## Use cases
- Learning defensive security concepts
- Supporting SOC / monitoring labs
- Experimenting with detection and analysis ideas

## Tech
- Python

## Positioning
These tools are intentionally minimal and meant as building blocks rather than full security products.
